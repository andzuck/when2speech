# when2speech-client

Right now, this app only works on Google Chrome because of the speech recognition tool and datetime parsing library we are using.

1. First, run the server in [andzuck/when2speech-server](https://github.com/andzuck/when2speech-server).
2. `npm run dev`
3. Go to relevant localhost in Google Chrome
